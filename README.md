# BellaBeat-Case-Study

The Bellabeat case study is a capstone project that I recently completed. Bellabeat’s product line is made up of the 
Bellabeat app, which allows user insight into user’s health by providing data on their activity, sleep, stress, 
menstrual cycle, and mindfulness habits.


I used R programming for this project, I performed analyses using R Studio. The four packages used in this project are tidyverse, dplyr, readr, and tidyr.


Business task : Collect and analyse usage data for both Bellabeat smart devices to better inform Bellabeat’s marketing and business strategy decisions.
